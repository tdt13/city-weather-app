# City Weather App  

This is a simple weather app that I built as part of my fullstack web dev bootcamp with CoGrammar. The application calls an API for weather based on user input for location and also, if the user allows it, the users GPS coordinates to provide the local weather to the user. This project allowed me to practice async API calls and React hooks such as useRef, useState, and useEffect.
